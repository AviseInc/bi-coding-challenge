# bi-coding-challenge

This is one of the Avise, Inc. coding challenges. Fork this repo and follow the Setup and Getting Started instructions
to begin. The goal of this coding challenge is for us to see how you approach solving problems with code. We do not
expect you to "complete" the skeleton code in thus repo. You are allowed, and even encouraged, to use whatever
references you would normally use when coding, including AI assistants.

The tech stack you will use is:

* Node
* Typescript
* Express
* Prisma ORM
* Postgres
* Mocha
